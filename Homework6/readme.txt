Create a responsive webpage layout that is as similar to the attached image as possible. Feel free to add in images or text to any of the boxes to see how the responsiveness really works with content.

You may use Foundation, Bootstrap or Skeleton or code it yourself from scratch.

But remember, the page must respond to resizing in order to be considered responsive
