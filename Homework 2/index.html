		<p> Hi everyone!</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>My name is Vasya Tarasov. I've moved from Russia to the US a couple years ago and live now in San Diego, one of the best cities in California. I fell in love with this beautiful place since the very moment I visited it for the first time in 2015. You can find a few pictures from my car trip throughout the West coast <a href="mytrip.html">here.</a></p>
		<p></p>
		<p>I work as a Software Developer at <a href="https://www.componentcontrol.com/">Component Control</a>, a company that develops a fully integrated business software solution designed for the aviation industry.</p>
		<p></p>
		<p>I've graduated from Russian State University with BS in Computer Science however I always try to learn new technology since it helps to remain competitive. Recently, I've succesfully finished the <a href="https://extension.ucsd.edu/courses-and-programs/c-programming">C# certificate program</a> at UC San Diego Extension.</p>
		<p></p>
