		<h3>These are my pictures from a trip that took place in August 2015</h3>

		<p><b>Bixby Creek Bridge</b>, also known as Bixby Bridge, on the Big Sur coast of California, is one of the most photographed bridges in California due to its aesthetic design, "graceful architecture and magnificent setting".It is a reinforced concrete open-spandrel arch bridge. The bridge is 120 miles (190 km) south of San Francisco and 13 miles (21 km) south of Carmel in Monterey County along State Route 1.</p>
		<p/>
		<p>Prior to the opening of the bridge in 1932, residents of the Big Sur area were virtually cut off during winter due to the often impassable Old Coast Road that led 11 miles (18 km) inland. At its completion, the bridge was built under budget for $199,861 (equivalent to $2.95 million in 2016 dollars) and at 360 feet (110 m) was the longest concrete arch span on the California State Highway System. It is one of the tallest single-span concrete bridges in the world.</p>

		<p><b>Point Lobos</b> and the <b>Point Lobos State Natural Reserve</b> is the "crown jewel" of California’s 280 state parks. It has two adjoining marine protected areas, Point Lobos State Marine Reserve (SMR) and Point Lobos State Marine Conservation Area (SMCA). Point Lobos is just south of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, United States, at the north end of the Big Sur coast of the Pacific Ocean.</p>
		<p/>
		<p>Point Lobos contains a number of hiking trails, many next to the ocean, and a smaller number of beaches. It is the site of a historic marine reserve, which was expanded in 2007. It is also the home to a museum on whaling, which includes a historic building once used by area fishermen. The longstanding wildlife protection and scenic seascape have led to Point Lobos' reputation as an unparalleled local recreational scuba diving destination.</p>

		<p>It's the fog that makes the Central and North coasts of California so wonderful for wine grape growing. Without it, we couldn't make the award winning wines that we are famous for. It's the very hot temperatures in the San Joaquin and Sacramento Valleys that pull in the cooler, coastal air that creates the fog. When summer ends, the fog becomes much less prevalent.</p>
